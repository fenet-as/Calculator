# 🧮 Simple Python Calculator (CLI)

This is a **command-line calculator** built in Python.  
It supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — with a colorful, user-friendly interface using the `colorama` library.

> 💡 This is my first Python project — created to practice conditionals, loops, functions, and user input handling.
